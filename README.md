# Pair
To pair a controller turn on your mini-skiddi and hold down the controller's pair button(on ps4 and ps5 press the share button and the ps button)(on xbox its the pair button on the top and the xbox logo) hold both buttons until the controller starts flashing

Here is the [bluepad32 docs](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32) this will have a list of controllers that will work

# Controls
Left joystick up/down is arm

Right joystick up/down is bucket

Right joystick left/right is claw

Square or X button is lights

L1 and L2 is for left track

R1 and R2 is for right track

-If you want you can change these to whatever you want (Note some changes may need you to change parts of the logic in the code)
